# We can be able to know how many times an item appers in an itereable. We cac use the counter() class

# First we import counter
from collections import Counter

# We then declare a list that has some repeated values in it
classmates = ["Consolata", "Gospel", "Marlin", "Consolata", "Marlin", "Fred"]

# Lets now use the counter class to see how many times Consolata has been repeated
count_conny = Counter(classmates).get("Consolata")

# Lets print out and see how many times the name appeared
print(f"The name Consolata appears in the list" f{count_consolata}items.")                                                                                                                                                    

# Output The name 
The name Consolata appears in the list 2
